## Can tundra Tracker be used with headsets other than the Valve Index, Vive, etc?
Yes, the Tundra Tracker can be used together with a range of non-SteamVR devices, like WMR, Oculus Quest and more.

There are guides online on how to “combine playspaces”. You’ll need the Tundra Trackers, (a) dongle(s), but also 2 SteamVR Base Stations to track them.
