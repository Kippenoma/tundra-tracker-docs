# Dongle Frequently Asked Questions

#### How can I update the firmware of Super Wireless Dongle?

The latest firmware will be distributed via SteamVR.


#### Where is the best placement for the dongle?

The dongle is sensitive to interference, so ideally place it “in view” of your Trackers (Not at the back of your computer), a top or front USB port is recommended. If you are using a Valve Index, the Headset “frunk” is a great spot for your dongle.


#### How many Trackers and Controllers can be paired at the same time?

3 devices can be paired with SW3, 5 devices can be paired with SW5 and 7 devices can be paired with SW7.

#### Can I place my SW dongle inside the Frunk of Valve Index?

SW3 and SW5 - yes. 
As for SW7, we do NOT recommend users to place it inside the Frunk as it may get overheated.

#### Where shall I contact if my Dongle is dead or broken?

TBD
